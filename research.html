With a team of eight researchers, several models are integrated to test policies on their impact on sustainability, including models that cover land use, transportation, environmental impacts, land cover and climate change. In the course of this two-year project, four workshops with international experts in model integration will be held to develop novel strategies of model integration. As a testbed, this project links with the <a href="http://smartgrowth.umd.edu/presto">PRESTO!</a> project that aims at developing a sustainable development strategy for the Baltimore-Washington region. Is is expected that through advanced model integration, this project will be able to develop and test stustainability strategies that cannot be analyzed with individual models alone. </p>

                    is a new land-use model that is designed as a discrete
                    choice microsimulation model. Discrete choice means that
                    decisions (such as a decision of a household to move to a
                    new dwelling) are modeled explicitly based on utilities at
                    the current dwelling location and expected utilities at
                    alternative dwelling locations. Being a microsimulation
                    model, every household and person is simulated individually.
                    SILO models household relocation, non-spatial demographic
                    changes (such as birth, aging, marriage or having children),
                    developers' decisions to build new residential buildings and
                    changes to dwellings over time (including renovation,
                    deterioration and demolition). <br>
                    <br>
                    SILO is built as a middle-weight tool. It is fully
                    integrated with a travel demand model, and therefore, more
                    complex than sketch-planning tools (such as CommunityViz or
                    UPlan). On the other hand, it is built to function with less
                    rigorous data collection and estimation requirements, making
                    SILO simpler to implement than traditional large-scale
                    land-use models (such as PECAS or UrbanSim). <br>
                    <br>
                    SILO is an open-source software and was initially developed
                    with funding by Parsons Brinckerhoff. The prototype
                    application was implemented for the Metropolitan Area of
                    Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. Currently, I am working as the Principal Investigator on an updated
                    version is implemented for the State of Maryland, funded by
                    the Maryland Department of Transportation. I have designed
                    and implemented this model from scratch. The <a href="http://silo.zone">SILO</a> website provides further
                    information. <br>

                    Maryland Statewide Transportation Model (MSTM) is an
                    advanced trip-based model that covers the State of Maryland
                    plus surrounding areas at the statewide layer and the
                    remainder of North America at the regional layer. Since
                    2006, the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) has
                    developed the MSTM with support from the National Center for
                    Smart Growth (NCSG) at the University of Maryland and
                    Parsons Brinckerhoff. MSTM is a multi-level model that
                    covers local trips and long-distance trips as well as person
                    travel and freight. It has become a policy decision support
                    tool that is applied extensively for scenario analysis,
                    corridor studies, project forecasts and future
                    transportation performance measurement.<br>
                    <br>
                    The MSTM is designed as a multi-level model that currently
                    works at two geographies. The statewide level covers not
                    only the State of Maryland but also surrounding areas,
                    including Washington, D.C., Delaware, and parts of New
                    Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. The
                    national layer covers the continental North America, including
                    Canada and Mexico. This national layer accounts for all
                    long-distance trips. A more detailed description of the MSTM
                    can be found on <a href="http://tfresource.org/Maryland_Statewide_Transportation_Model">tfresource</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    I have worked on most modules of the MSTM, some of which I
                    designed from scratch. As the Principal Investigator, I am currently revising the model to
                    work from a Synthetic Population that has been created with
                    SILO, and on integrating the MSTM with an auto-ownership
                    model. <br>

                    <br>
                    Travel demand models use zones as origins and destinations
                    of trips. Commonly, such zones are derived from census
                    tracts or other spatial definitions of neighborhoods. Urban
                    zones are smaller and rural zones are larger, but
                    consistency in spatial resolution across the study area is
                    rarely achieved. Creating a new zone system is a manual and
                    laborious effort, and therefore, rarely undertaken. <br>

                    For the Georgia statewide model, I developed a method to
                    generate raster cells that are smaller in urban areas and
                    larger in rural areas. By allocating many smaller raster
                    cells to dense areas, resources are allocated most
                    efficiently. The resolution across the study area is
                    consistent, i.e. the resolution changes with density and
                    different areas with the same density receive approximately
                    the same number of raster cells. The procedure is very
                    flexible and can generate just a few raster cells or many
                    raster cells, depending on the resolution needed for a
                    certain purpose. This raster cell procedure is currently
                    refined for the <a href="#mstm">Maryland Statewide
                      Transportation Model</a>. With help of the graduate
                    student Yuchen Cui, raster cells are not defined based on
                    population and employment (as implemented in Georgia) but
                    based on number of trips generated.&nbsp;The code  is open-source and can be downloaded here: <a href="http://moeckel.github.io/gr/">http://moeckel.github.io/gr/</a>.</td>
